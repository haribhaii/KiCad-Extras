# KiCad Extension Library - KiCad Extras

A growing collection of custom **KiCad symbols, footprints, and 3D models** created during personal projects, internships, and real-world PCB design work.

This repository is maintained to help **students, hobbyists, and engineers** speed up prototyping and reduce repetitive library creation in KiCad.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer (IMPORTANT)

> **These libraries are NOT officially verified.**  
> They are created for learning, prototyping, and experimental use.

Always cross-check:
- Footprint dimensions  
- Pin numbering  
- Datasheets  
- Courtyard and clearance rules  

before using them in production or critical designs.

The maintainer is not responsible for manufacturing or functional issues resulting from direct usage.
